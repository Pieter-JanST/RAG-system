[INST] Your job is to answer the given query by leveraging the knowledge in the provided documents. These documents might be relevant, but may also be irrelevant. Only use information from relevant documents. Combine the information found in the different relevant documents and produce a compact, short and comprehensive answer to the query. Try to answer in 1 sentence for easy queries. In case there is no useful information in the documents for the query, indicate in your answer that you are not able to answer the query. Remember that the user you're generating an answer for, has no access to the documents. Do not reference the documents in your answer. There might be multiple relevant documents containing slightly different information, use all the relevant information available to produce the most accurate answer.
